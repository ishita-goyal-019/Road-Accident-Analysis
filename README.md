## 🎯 Problem Statement:

- The objective of this project is to analyze user behavior on the Road Accident using Exploratory Data Analysis. 
- The challenge is to uncover insights into user preferences, viewing patterns, and trends by analyzing a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle.
  - Casualites by vehicle type.
  - Casualites by Road type.
  - Casualites by Urban/Rural areas.
  - Create slicers to assess case severity in different Road surface and Weather conditions.
  - Casualites by location.
- This analysis will provide valuable information for content creators, marketers, and platform optimization.

 ## 💡 Insights Derived
 
**Road Type Distribution**: A bar chart show the distribution of casualties based on road type . This can highlight whether accidents are more prevalent on certain types of roads.

**Urban vs. Rural Comparison**: A Pie chart compare casualties in urban and rural areas over time or by demographic factors. This can highlight whether accidents are more common in one type of area.

**Accident Heatmap**: A heatmap overlaid on a map can show the concentration of accidents in specific geographic areas. This can help identify accident hotspots, which are areas with a high number of casualties.

## 🔮 Future Scope

**AI and Machine Learning**: Utilizing AI and ML algorithms for real-time accident detection and response.

**Predictive Analytics**: Developing predictive models for accident prevention and early warning systems.

**Blockchain Integration**: Using blockchain for secure and transparent accident data sharing among stakeholders.

**Traffic Simulation**: Using simulation models to test and validate safety measures before implementation.
